swing-menu-corr Usage
=====================

When you downloaded the ZIP archive from GitHub <https://github.com/haniibrahim/swing-menu-corr> in your Download directory, decompress it with:

  unzip ~/Downloads/swing-menu-corr-master.zip

in the terminal. When you downloaded the TAR.GZ archive <https://github.com/haniibrahim/swing-menu-corr/releases> do the following in the terminal:

  tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/swing-menu-corr-[version].tar.gz

or use your graphical archive manager (e.g. file-roller).

Move to the new created directory "swing-menu-corr-master/" and run the script "swing-menu.corr.sh":

  cd ~/Downloads/swing-menu-corr-master
  sudo swing-menu-corr.sh

Confirm the appearing question with the ENTER-key or type "y" or "Y" (without double quotes) if you want to proceed.

If you are not on Linux Mint 17.x the script will ask you if you really want to proceed (Keep in mind, that the script "swing-menu-undo.sh" can always undo the changes "swing-menu-corr.sh" will do).

-----------------------------------------------------

If you like to undo what "swing-menu-corr.sh" did, run the following script in the terminal, e.g.:

  sudo ~/Downloads/swing-menu-corr-master/swing-menu-undo.sh
  
The path can be different in your environment.
